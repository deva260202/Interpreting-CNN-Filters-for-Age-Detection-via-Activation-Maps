# Interpreting-CNN-Filters-for-Age-Detection-via-Activation-Maps
This project aims to visualize activation maps within a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for age detection. By analyzing these maps, we can identify which image regions are most influential in the network's age prediction process.
